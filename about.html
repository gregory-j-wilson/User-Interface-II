                <p>Hi there! My name is Gregory Wilson and I love life!  I am married to a wonderful woman Isela as of June 14th, 2019,
                and I have the cutest dearest 6-year-old step-daughter in the world (at least to me).  My coding journey started when I was 
                young, just picking up some basic html from some internet sites - I believe one was called activejump.com!  Since then, I have progressed and used code to build 4 complete real websites that are running on the internet today.
                I hope you enjoy my site and feel free to reach out if I could be of any help with YOUR web design project!
                </p> <br>
                <p>I studied at Treehouse and now am studying happily at Lambda School, preparing to be a full stack web developer.</p>
